# Fetch.ai Hackathon

We're thrilled to invite you to the Fetch.ai Hackathon, where you'll have the chance to showcase your skills by creating innovative uAgents using Fetch.ai's powerful uAgent library. Get ready to build intelligent agents that tackle real-world challenges and compete for exciting prizes!

# **About:**

The Fetch.ai Hackathon is a coding competition that challenges developers, programmers, and AI enthusiasts to build uAgents, autonomous intelligent agents, using Fetch.ai's uAgent library. These agents will perform various tasks, from monitoring temperatures to tracking currency exchange rates, delivering daily news, and notifying you about local events.

## Duration

20th September - 22nd September

# Themes

### 1. **Temperature Alert Agent:**

Create an agent that alerts users when the temperature in their chosen location falls outside their preferred range. Perfect for weather enthusiasts and travelers!

- Connects to a free weather API to fetch real-time temperatures for the specified location.
- Lets users set their preferred temperature range (e.g., a minimum and maximum
temperature) and location.
- Sends an alert/notification to the user when the current temperature in their chosen
location goes below the minimum or above the maximum threshold they've set.

### 2. **Currency Exchange Monitor & Alert Agent:**

Build an agent that keeps an eye on currency exchange rates and notifies users when rates cross their specified thresholds. Great for traders and globetrotters!

- Allows users to select their base currency and one or more foreign currencies they wish
to monitor.
- Connects to a currency exchange API to fetch real-time exchange rates.
- Let users set thresholds for alerts (e.g., notify me if 1 USD becomes more than 0.85
EUR or less than 0.80 EUR).
- Sends an alert/notification to the user when the exchange rate crosses the thresholds
they've set.

### 3. **Daily News Agent:**

Develop an agent that curates the top headlines of the day and delivers them in a user-friendly format. Tailor it to cater to different news categories, ensuring users stay informed on their areas of interest.

- Connects to a news API to fetch the day's top headlines.
- Filters and selects the three most significant news stories.
- Presents these stories to the user every morning in a concise and readable format.

**Considerations:
Think about how users might want to customize the categories of news they're most
interested in (e.g., world news, technology, sports).**

### 4. **Local Event Notifier Agent:**

Craft an agent that keeps users informed about upcoming local events based on their preferences. Ideal for social butterflies and culture aficionados!

- Connects to a reliable event listing API or website to fetch upcoming local events.
- Allows users to set their location.
- Filters events based on user preferences like event categories (e.g., music, arts).
- Sends notifications about these events at user-defined intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
- Provides a quick overview of the event details when notified, such as venue, time, and
date.
